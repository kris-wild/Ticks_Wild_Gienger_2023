## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

## Including Plots

A total of 89 lizards were captured (females n= 38; males n= 51) during the 2014 and 2015 field seasons. The frequency of tick infections was highly sex-specific, with only five females (13%) documented with tick infections compared to 20 males (39%) with tick infections (x2 = 6.09, df = 1, n = 89, p = 0.01). Females were therefore precluded from further statistical analysis due to the low frequency of tick infections. There was a weak positive relationship between male body size and number of ticks (r2 = 0.07, F1,51 = 3.76, p = 0.06), where larger males had higher frequencies of ticks than smaller males (Fig. 1). Of the 51 males captured, a total of 20 lizards were infected with ticks and infection rate ranged one to seven ticks per individual.  Maximum sprint speed was significantly higher in uninfected lizards (LS mean = 2.76 m/sec) in comparison to infected lizards (LS mean = 2.51 m/sec; F2,49 = 4.74; p = 0.03; Fig. 2a). Maximum 2-meter run speed was significantly higher in uninfected lizards (LS mean = 1.94 m/sec) than in infected lizards (LS mean = 1.63 m/sec; F2,49 = 7.40; p < 0.01; Fig. 2b). There were no differences in body condition indices between uninfected and infected lizards (F2,49 = 0.27; p = 0.60)

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
